# Module1-Challenge
* Please note, I have submitted the file 'Challenge 1 Sheet' in order to only include the two deliverables
* If you would like to see the sheet I did all my class work on, please ask!
## Overview of Project
* Louise Fever play w/ fundraising goal fell short due to time 
* Wants to know how different campaigns did in relation to: 
*   1. Launch dates
*   2. Funding goals
* Use Kickstarter dataset 
* Outcome: using the kickstarter data, was able to generate outcomes based on goals (line graph) and use pivot tables to show start date data for the category of 'theater'. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Two conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Date:

* A. Table Outputs
Based off the raw data, I filtered by parent category of theater and then displayed January-Decemeber. I like to start my analysis by looking at the table before charts. Clearly May (111) and June (100) look promising in terms of having 'success'. Yet, as we begin to look column of 'failed' campaigns, May (52) and June (49) had two of the three highest failure outcomes. In other words, we advise Louise to take a closer look at other months before deciding that a summer production is best. 
* B. Pivot Chart 
By observing the chart, it is once again clear that the dates of May-August have large figures for success. We also notice that on average Nov-December seem to peform poorly. Interestingly, May, June, July, and August seem to have a large ratio between successful and failed campaigns. For instance, we noticed that in the month of May 111 campaigns had success to only 52 failures or 2.13X difference. This is relatively consistent in each of these months, so we recommend Louise place her plays/theater productions in this time frame. Otherwise, we can also comment on the nature of cancelled productions. We noticed the most cancellations at May (166), and June (153). Ideally, a production launch anytime after April, but before June seems to be the most ideal. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
